I'll analyze the repository to understand the current README structure and context for adding a riddle.
Now let me examine the current README content:
Perfect. I have all the information I need. Let me create the research findings with my plan.

```markdown
# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
This is the PostHog PHP SDK repository. The README.md is a clean, well-structured documentation file at `/Users/js/github/posthog-php/README.md`. It currently contains:
- Project title (PostHog PHP)
- Links to main PostHog documentation
- Features list (event capture, feature flags, multivariate flags, group analytics, test coverage)
- Quick Start section with setup instructions
- Community link (Slack)
- Contributing guidelines

The file is 30 lines of clear, markdown-formatted documentation.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/js/github/posthog-php/README.md`
- **Location**: Can be added at various points in the document (before/after features, before questions section, at the end, etc.)

## Implementation Context
The README follows standard structure: title → overview/links → features → quick start → support → contributing. The document is concise and professional, focused on integration guidance rather than entertainment or narrative content.

## Clarifying Questions

### Question 1: Where should the riddle be placed in the README?
**Options:**
- a) After the project title and before the main PostHog docs links (creates a unique, engaging entry point)
- b) After the Features section, before Quick Start (provides a fun break in technical content)
- c) At the very end after Contributing section (as an Easter egg)
- d) Something else (please specify)

### Question 2: What type/theme of riddle would you like?
**Options:**
- a) A PostHog/analytics-related riddle (thematic to the project)
- b) A PHP-related riddle (language-specific)
- c) A generic clever riddle (language/framework agnostic)
- d) Something else (please specify)
```

<ExitPlanMode>
<parameter name="plan">## Plan: Add Riddle to README

### Current State
- README.md exists at `/Users/js/github/posthog-php/README.md` with 30 lines of documentation
- Standard structure: title → docs links → features → quick start → community → contributing

### Implementation
1. Determine placement and riddle type based on your clarifying questions
2. Add the riddle to the README.md file in the chosen location
3. Ensure formatting is consistent with the rest of the document

### What happens after you confirm:
1. I'll add the riddle to the README.md file at your specified location
2. The change will be ready for review/commit
