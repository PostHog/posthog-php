I'll analyze the repository structure and README to understand what needs to be updated.
Now let me read the current README:
Let me check the project structure and key files to better understand what might need to be documented:
Let me check the git history to understand what changes were recently made:
Let me check what the recent commit context is:
Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive plan. The current README is quite minimal and there's rich functionality in the project that could be better documented. However, the task description is vague ("add something to readme"). Let me exit plan mode and present what I've found:
The task description is quite vague: "add something to readme". Before I can create a concrete plan, I need clarification on what content should be added to the README.

## Analysis Summary

I've reviewed the PostHog PHP SDK repository and the current README. Here's what I found:

**Current README Status:**
- Very minimal - only 30 lines
- Links to external PostHog documentation
- Lists 5 key features (event capture, feature flags, dependencies, multivariate flags, group analytics)
- Has basic Quick Start and Contributing sections

**Repository Context:**
- Version 3.7.2 with recent feature additions (flag dependencies in v3.7.0)
- Comprehensive example.php with interactive demonstrations
- Full test suite and development infrastructure
- Requires PHP 8.0+

**Content Opportunities:**
The README could be expanded with:
1. **Installation/Configuration** - composer setup, environment variables, configuration options
2. **Feature Documentation** - deeper explanation of local evaluation, flag dependencies, multivariate flags
3. **Development Guide** - testing, building, contribution workflow
4. **Usage Examples** - code snippets showing common tasks

## Question: What specific content should be added to the README?

Could you clarify what aspect(s) of the project should be documented? For example:
- **Installation & configuration guide**?
- **Feature explanations** (especially the newer flag dependencies feature)?
- **Development/contribution setup**?
- **Usage examples or code snippets**?
- **All of the above or something else**?

This will help me create a detailed implementation plan.
