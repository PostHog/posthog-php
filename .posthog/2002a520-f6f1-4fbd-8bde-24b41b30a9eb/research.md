I'll help you understand the codebase to plan adding X to the README. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding the current state of the documentation.
Now let me read the current README to understand its structure and what "X" might refer to:
Let me check the project structure to better understand what this library does:
I need to clarify what "X" refers to in the task. The description is too vague for me to create an accurate plan. Let me use the Plan agent to help gather this information:
I need to clarify what "X" refers to before I can create a meaningful plan. The task description "add X to readme" uses a placeholder without specifying what content should be added.

Based on my exploration of the PostHog PHP repository, I can see this is a well-maintained library with recent updates. However, without knowing what specifically should be added to the README, I cannot create an accurate implementation plan.

Could you please clarify what "X" represents? For example:

- **A specific feature or capability** that needs documentation in the README?
- **Installation or setup instructions** that are currently missing?
- **API usage examples** that should be included?
- **A recent change or fix** that needs to be documented?
- **Something else** from the codebase that isn't currently documented?

Once you clarify what content should be added to the README, I'll be able to provide a comprehensive analysis and plan for the implementation.
